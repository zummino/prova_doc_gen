# SECTION 1 — System Overview

This section introduces the purpose, scope, and main capabilities of the pyicub software system as evidenced by the repository. It summarizes how the library is organized, what it provides to application developers and integrators, and the runtime environment and dependencies inferred directly from the codebase. No architectural diagrams are included in this section.

## Purpose and Scope

The pyicub repository provides a Python-based control and integration layer for the iCub humanoid robot via YARP (Yet Another Robot Platform). It exposes:

- Low-level robot controllers for joint positions and gaze through YARP drivers.
- Mid-level modules for speech, facial expressions, cameras, face landmarks, visual attention, and LLM-backed interaction.
- A high-level orchestration “helper” that composes controllers and modules into a unified runtime.
- An action system for defining full-body, multi-step movements (including gaze and custom calls) that can be exported/imported as JSON.
- A finite state machine (FSM) framework integrated with the action system and exposed over a REST API.
- A REST server exposing helper methods, controllers, FSMs, and actions as remote services, with subscription/notification for long-running requests.
- A concurrent request execution and monitoring subsystem for time-bounded, cancellable operations.

The scope of the repository is a complete application stack (library and server) for controlling iCub or icubSim. It includes command-line utilities to build and run action and FSM repositories, as well as a REST server process to expose robot skills to external clients.

## System Capabilities and Features

The system enables developers to build iCub applications in Python that:

- Command robot joints in position mode for head, torso, arms, hands, and legs using YARP remote_controlboard.
- Control and monitor the robot gaze using iKinGazeCtrl through a YARP client.
- Express facial emotions and raw face commands via YARP ports.
- Access camera image streams and camera host/port information; obtain network-accessible MJPEG URIs.
- Read face landmarks and number of detected faces from YARP topics through buffered read ports.
- Drive speech via iSpeak with synchronous completion detection, including speaking text from files or randomly from folders.
- Perform visual attention tasks (observe/search/track points or areas) safely within specified gaze angle ranges, using gaze motion and optional target providers.
- Interact with an external LLM/GPT through a YARP RPC protocol for status, query, session, and model control.
- Define reusable full-body actions with steps, per-limb trajectories, timeouts, gaze commands, and custom calls; serialize them to/from JSON; parameterize templates.
- Construct, run, and observe FSMs that orchestrate actions; integrate FSM transitions with REST subscription/notification for state entry/exit events.
- Execute all motions and services via an asynchronous request manager with per-request timeouts, thread-based execution, and optional CSV logging.
- Expose helper functions, controllers, actions, and FSMs via a REST server (Flask) with a proxyable registry, subscriber topics, and synchronous/asynchronous invocation; includes a Python REST client.

Runtime configuration supports both physical robot (“icub”) and simulator (“icubSim”) selection via environment variables, and optional logging and API enablement through environment-based configuration.

## Codebase Structure Summary

The following table lists all modules and files present in the repository and their responsibilities as implemented.

| Path | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| pyicub/__init__.py | Package metadata: name, authors, emails, license, version, description. |
| pyicub/utils.py | Utility functions: SingletonMeta, vector ops (distance, norm), reflection helpers (getPublicMethods, getDecoratedMethods), package info, firstAvailablePort, JSON import/export. |
| pyicub/core/logger.py | Logging abstractions. YarpLogger proxies to yarp.Log when yarp present; PyicubLogger configures Python logging with stream/file handlers. Falls back to PyicubLogger if yarp not installed. |
| pyicub/core/ports.py | YARP port wrappers. BufferedPort with open/read/write/prepare; BufferedReadPort connects to source and optional callback; BufferedWritePort connects to destination. CustomCallback delegates to user callback. |
| pyicub/core/rpc.py | YARP RPC client wrapper with connection management and command execution (Bottle-based). |
| pyicub/controllers/position.py | Position control for robot parts over YARP remote_controlboard. Defines ICUB_PARTS taxonomy and iCubPart specifications (names, joints, speeds). PositionController initializes IEncoders, IControlLimits, IControlMode, IPositionControl, handles motion commands with speed/time, waitMotionDone policies, encoder verification, and exposes lower-level getters. Includes RemoteControlboard driver. |
| pyicub/controllers/gaze.py | Gaze control through iKinGazeCtrl via yarp.PolyDriver gazecontrollerclient. Provides absolute/relative angle look, 3D fixation point conversion, blocking/clearing eyes/neck, tracking mode, and motion onset/wait helpers with logging. |
| pyicub/modules/emotions.py | Face emotions sender over YARP via BufferedWritePort to /<robot>/face/emotions/in; helpers to set specific emotion patterns, color, brightness, and generic “set” commands. |
| pyicub/modules/face.py | Raw face command sender via BufferedWritePort to /<robot>/face/raw/in. |
| pyicub/modules/camera.py | Camera client using yarp.BufferedPortImageRgb. Connects to appropriate camera output (real or sim). Provides image resolution, underlying YARP port and host info, HTTP URI builder for image streaming, and cleanup on destruction. |
| pyicub/modules/faceLandmarks.py | Face landmarks subscriber using BufferedReadPort for /faceLandmarks/landmarks:o and /faces:o; maintains current landmarks and face count; getter helpers. |
| pyicub/modules/speech.py | Speech control. speechPyCtrl writes “say”, “setPitch”, “setSpeed” to /<robot>/speech:rpc. iSpeakPyCtrl writes text to /iSpeak and uses RPC to poll speaking status for sync completion; includes speaking from file/folder helpers with validation and logging. |
| pyicub/modules/llm.py | iLLM RPC client abstraction for an LLM service at /LLM/rpc:i; operations for status, query, system prompt, sessions, model selection, quit. iGPT specialization binds to /GPT/rpc:i. |
| pyicub/modules/attention.py | VisualAttention subsystem using gaze controller. Defines VisualTarget abstraction; safe angle checks; grid sampling on ellipsoids; observe workspace/scene/points; search target strategies; track moving points with stop support and locks; stable target waiting; structured logging. |
| pyicub/actions.py | Action model. JointPose, JointsTrajectoryCheckpoint, LimbMotion, GazeMotion, PyiCubCustomCall; iCubFullbodyStep and iCubFullbodyAction with JSON import/export and composition; parameterized templates (iCubActionTemplate, iCubActionTemplateImportedJSON) with substitution; ActionsManager for discovery/import from module, registry, and export. |
| pyicub/fsm.py | FSM abstraction using transitions GraphMachine. FSM with states, transitions, triggers, drawing, JSON import/export, runStep execution and session/state counts. iCubFSM extends FSM to bind actions (on_enter triggers play actions via app), import/export with actions, and integration with iCubRESTApp. |
| pyicub/requests.py | Asynchronous request execution. iCubRequest manages a target function in a single-thread executor with timeout, status (INIT/RUNNING/TIMEOUT/DONE/FAILED), cancellation and thread termination, timing metadata, and logging. iCubRequestsManager is a singleton that creates/launches requests, tracks pending futures, joins, logs optionally to CSV, and finalizes with callbacks. |
| pyicub/rest.py | REST infrastructure using Flask and CORS. Core entities (RESTJSON, RESTRobot, RESTApp, RESTTopic, iCubRESTService, RESTService). iCubRESTServer exposes registry endpoints, routes for listing robots/apps/services, proxying remote services, subscription/notification, and publish-subscribe topic management. iCubRESTManager adds request/process listings, registration/unregistration for services with proxy replication, and request-based execution semantics (sync/async). PyiCubApp wires logging, request manager, and optional REST manager via environment variables. PyiCubRESTfulServer registers utility and custom services, exposes decorated methods, and can attach an FSM. iCubRESTApp is the primary server for the iCub helper: it detects managed mode, owns or delegates to a remote helper, registers helper subservices (gaze, speech, emo, cameras, attention, gpt, actions), imports actions, and configures FSM integration. iCubRESTSubscriber and RESTSubscriberFSM implement subscription to FSM runStep events with enter/exit callbacks. PyiCubRESTfulClient provides a Python client for invoking services and managing requests. |
| pyicub/helper.py | High-level orchestrator. Initializes YARP, constructs and caches PositionControllers for all parts, builds/initializes GazeController, and lazily instantiates modules (emo, speech, face, facelandmarks, cameras, attention, gpt). Provides action lifecycle (import/export, play/run), motion execution (per-limb, steps, gaze), custom call execution, port monitoring, and request orchestration via iCubRequestsManager. Supports robot selection (icub/icubSim) via ICUB_SIMULATION. Includes singleton-by-robot-name behavior and graceful shutdown. |
| pyicub/proc/actionizer.py | CLI tool to build actions from a Python module to JSON, or run actions by ID from a JSON repository using iCub helper. |
| pyicub/proc/fsmizer.py | CLI tool to build/export FSMs from a Python module to JSON and graph images. |
| pyicub/proc/icubapi.py | Entrypoint that instantiates iCubRESTApp and starts the REST manager loop. |
| pyicub/requests.py (duplicate in table for clarity) | See above. |
| setup.py | Package setup referencing pyicub metadata. |

## External Dependencies and Runtime Environment

The implementation relies on the following external libraries and services, as seen in imports and usage:

- YARP (yarp): Required for all robot communications (PolyDriver, BufferedPort, RpcClient, Log, Vector, Network). Multiple modules call yarp.Network().init().
- Flask and Flask-CORS: REST server and CORS handling (flask, flask_cors).
- transitions: FSM state machine engine (GraphMachine).
- requests: HTTP client used by REST proxying, registry, and subscribers.
- numpy: Used in visual attention and speech modules (grid generation, RNG).
- threading, concurrent.futures: Request execution, callbacks, and subscription worker threads.
- Environment variables: ICUB_SIMULATION (selects “icub” vs “icubSim”); PYICUB_LOGGING, PYICUB_LOGGING_PATH (logging); PYICUB_API and PYICUB_API_* (REST manager host/port/proxy).

At runtime, the system can operate against a simulated robot (icubSim) or a real robot (icub), connects to specific YARP ports for motion controllers (remote_controlboard) and gaze (/iKinGazeCtrl), and can expose a REST API on a configurable host/port with an optional proxy for registry mirroring.

| pyicub/__init__.py | metadata | Package metadata: name, authors, license, version, description. |
| pyicub/actions.py | JointsTrajectoryCheckpoint; LimbMotion; PyiCubCustomCall; GazeMotion; iCubFullbodyStep; iCubFullbodyAction; TemplateParameter; iCubActionTemplate; iCubActionTemplateImportedJSON; ActionsManager | Action modeling: limb trajectories, gaze motion, custom calls, action composition into steps, JSON import/export. Templating allows parameterized actions and JSON-based templates. ActionsManager loads actions from modules, assigns IDs, and exports as JSON. |
| pyicub/fsm.py | FSM | Finite State Machine based on transitions GraphMachine. Adds logging, JSON import/export, drawing, session bookkeeping, and runStep to trigger transitions. |
| pyicub/helper.py | iCubSingleton (metaclass); iCub; PortMonitor | Orchestrator facade. Initializes PositionControllers for all known parts, GazeController, actions import, and services (emotions, speech, face, faceLandmarks, cameras, VisualAttention, GPT). Exposes high-level operations: movePart, moveStep, moveSteps, playAction, moveGaze, execCustomCall(s), and a port monitor. Uses iCubRequestsManager for async execution and PyicubLogger/YarpLogger for logging. |
| pyicub/requests.py | iCubRequest; iCubRequestsManager | Asynchronous request execution with per-request thread pools, timeouts, cancellation, and CSV logging (optional). The manager creates requests, runs/join them, maintains pending futures, and supports finalization callbacks. |

PyiCubApp configures logging and optional REST manager with proxying. PyiCubRESTfulServer registers class and decorated methods as REST targets. iCubRESTApp binds the iCub helper and its modules into the REST tree (helper, gaze, speech, emo, cam_left/right, attention, gpt, actions, FSM). Client and subscriber utilities provide remote control and FSM subscription. FSMsManager discovers and exports FSMs. |
| pyicub/utils.py | SingletonMeta; vector_distance; norm; getPublicMethods; getDecoratedMethods; getPyiCubInfo; firstAvailablePort; importFromJSONFile; exportJSONFile | General utilities: math helpers, reflection of public/decorated methods, package info, first-available-port probing, and JSON file I/O. |
| setup.py | setup() | Packaging metadata using setuptools; imports pyicub metadata. |

Notes:
- All YARP device and port names, as well as REST routes, are taken directly from the code (no inferred or invented endpoints).
- The iCub helper transparently selects "icubSim" vs "icub" when the ICUB_SIMULATION environment variable equals "true".
- REST base path is "http://<host>:<port>/pyicub", with dynamic registration of targets under "/<robot>/<app>/<target>" as implemented in iCubRESTServer/iCubRESTManager.
- Asynchronous execution is uniformly handled via iCubRequestsManager and iCubRequest, including timeouts and structured logging.

% 5 — Code-Level View
# Section 5 — Code‑Level View

This section maps the implemented architecture to concrete source code elements and explains how the codebase is structured, initialized, and executed. It identifies entry points, shows how the main architectural components are realized in the repository, and highlights recognizable design patterns based solely on the provided code.

## 5.1 Purpose and Scope

The aim is to provide a faithful, verifiable mapping from architectural concepts to the codebase. It enables developers and integrators to:
- Locate the implementation of each architectural component.
- Understand runtime entry points, startup flow, and dependencies.
- Recognize cross‑cutting concerns such as logging, concurrency, and REST exposure.
This description derives strictly from the provided source code; no speculative elements are introduced.

## 5.2 Architectural Components → Source Code Mapping

The codebase follows a layered, service‑oriented structure on top of YARP (Yet Another Robot Platform), with a RESTful management layer. The main components and their implementation locations are:

| Architectural Component | Responsibility | Source Code | Key Classes / Elements |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core utilities | Logging, YARP port wrappers, RPC client | pyicub/core | logger.py: _Logger, YarpLogger, PyicubLogger; ports.py: Buffered(Read/Write)Port, CustomCallback; rpc.py: RpcClient |
| Device controllers | Hardware adapters for gaze and joints | pyicub/controllers | gaze.py: GazeControllerPolyDriver, GazeController; position.py: RemoteControlboard, PositionController (+ iCubPart, JointPose) |
| Functional modules | High‑level robot functions | pyicub/modules | attention.py: VisualAttention; camera.py: cameraPyCtrl; emotions.py: emotionsPyCtrl; face.py: facePyCtrl; faceLandmarks.py: faceLandmarksPyCtrl; llm.py: iLLM, iGPT; speech.py: speechPyCtrl, iSpeakPyCtrl |
| Action model | Full‑body actions and templates | pyicub/actions.py | iCubFullbodyAction, iCubFullbodyStep, LimbMotion, GazeMotion, JointsTrajectoryCheckpoint, iCubActionTemplate(+ImportedJSON), ActionsManager, TemplateParameter |
| FSM model | Finite state machines, action‑driven FSMs | pyicub/fsm.py | FSM, iCubFSM |
| Orchestration / Facade | High‑level helper that wires controllers, modules, actions, requests | pyicub/helper.py | iCub (singleton facade), PortMonitor |
| Async execution | Request lifecycle, thread‑backed futures | pyicub/requests.py | iCubRequest, iCubRequestsManager |
| REST layer | REST server, app, proxying, client, subscribers | pyicub/rest.py | iCubRESTServer, iCubRESTManager, PyiCubApp, PyiCubRESTfulServer, iCubRESTApp, iCubRESTSubscriber, RESTSubscriberFSM, PyiCubRESTfulClient, REST* DTOs, rest_service decorator |
| Process entry points | CLI tools and REST server bootstrap | pyicub/proc | actionizer.py, fsmizer.py, icubapi.py |
| Utilities | Helpers for reflection, JSON I/O, math, network ports | pyicub/utils.py | SingletonMeta, getPublicMethods, getDecoratedMethods, import/export JSON, firstAvailablePort, vector_distance, norm |
| Packaging | Distribution metadata | setup.py, pyicub/__init__.py | setup configuration; package metadata |

This mapping is exhaustive for the files in the provided repository.

## 5.3 Main Entry Points and Runtime Initialization

There are three executable scripts under pyicub/proc, each with a clear invocation model:

| Entry Point | Invocation | Function | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| pyicub/proc/actionizer.py | python -m pyicub.proc.actionizer build --module <module> --target <dir> | main() | Build step: introspect Python module for iCubFullbodyAction subclasses via ActionsManager.importActionsFromModule and export JSON definitions. |
|  | python -m pyicub.proc.actionizer run --actions <ids...> --source <json_repo_dir> | main() | Run step: instantiate iCub with action repository and play listed actions via iCub.playAction. |
| pyicub/proc/fsmizer.py | python -m pyicub.proc.fsmizer build --module <module> --target <dir> | main() | Build FSMs: introspect Python module for iCubFSM subclasses via FSMsManager.importFSMsFromModule, export .json and .png diagrams. |
|  | python -m pyicub.proc.fsmizer run --fsm <name> --source <json_repo_dir> | main() | Placeholder for executing an FSM (currently “pass”). |
| pyicub/proc/icubapi.py | python -m pyicub.proc.icubapi | app.rest_manager.run_forever() | Starts a REST server iCubRESTApp; registers helper services and runs Flask loop with auto‑port advance on conflict. |

Runtime initialization (REST path):
- iCubRESTApp resolves robot name (ICUB_SIMULATION env var), instantiates PyiCubApp (initializes logging, requests manager, REST manager depending on env), configures helper methods, imports actions, and registers helper sub‑APIs (gaze, speech, emotions, cameras, attention, GPT) into the REST registry.
- The Flask server is run via iCubRESTManager.run_forever with listener port selection and subscriber cleanup on shutdown.

Runtime initialization (Helper path):
- iCub is a keyed singleton (per robot_name) that initializes all defined iCubPart controllers, gaze controller, ActionsManager, VisualAttention facade, optional GPT client, and services (emotions, speech, cameras, face landmarks). It wires into the provided iCubRequestsManager or creates one.

## 5.4 Source Code Elements by Module

## 5.5 Recognizable Architectural/Design Patterns

The code exhibits the following patterns, evidenced by the implementation:

- Facade: iCub in helper.py aggregates controllers, modules, action execution, and exposes a simplified API to higher layers and REST.
- Adapter: controllers/gaze.py and controllers/position.py adapt YARP interfaces (PolyDriver, I*Control) into Python objects with domain semantics.
- Singleton: Widespread use via SingletonMeta (iCubRequestsManager), class‑specific singletons (PyicubLogger, YarpLogger, PyiCubApp), and keyed singleton (iCubSingleton).
- State: FSM built on transitions.GraphMachine; iCubFSM composes actions as states with on_enter behavior.
- Template Method / Parameterization: iCubActionTemplate defines a replace‑params pipeline for rendering parameterized actions; iCubActionTemplateImportedJSON loads template definitions externally.
- Command/Future: iCubRequest encapsulates an executable with timeout, result, and status; managed by iCubRequestsManager with completion callbacks and optional CSV logging.
- Observer/Pub‑Sub: RESTSubscriberFSM plus iCubRESTManager’s subscribe/notify model provide topic notifications for request lifecycle (enter/exit) over HTTP.
- Layered architecture: core → controllers → modules → helper/orchestration → REST.

These patterns are directly inferable from class structures and method calls.

## 5.6 Key Module Dependencies

- YARP: device control (PolyDriver, IGazeControl, remote_controlboard), ports (BufferedPortBottle, Bottle, RpcClient), images, delays.
- Flask/Flask‑CORS: REST server.
- transitions: FSM engine and diagram export.
- requests (HTTP): REST proxying and client calls.
- numpy: random selection and vector operations in speech/attention modules.
- logging: extensive throughout, with both YARP logger and Python logging fallback.

## 5.7 Runtime Configuration and Environment

- ICUB_SIMULATION: if “true”, selects robot_name “icubSim” in iCub and iCubRESTApp.
- PYICUB_LOGGING, PYICUB_LOGGING_PATH: enable/route Python logging output in PyiCubApp.
- PYICUB_API: when “true”, starts the REST manager inside PyiCubApp.
- PYICUB_API_RESTMANAGER_HOST/PORT: bind address for REST manager; port auto‑incremented to firstAvailablePort.
- PYICUB_API_PROXY_HOST/PORT/SCHEME: proxy registration hub; iCubRESTManager mirrors services to the proxy if not itself the proxy.

## 5.8 Concurrency and Blocking Behavior

- Asynchronous requests: iCub.moveStep and runAction create multiple iCubRequest instances for gaze, limbs, and custom calls. Each request runs in its own thread (single‑thread executor), and the manager joins at step/action boundaries.
- Timeouts: iCubRequest supervises targets with a separate future; on timeout, it cancels and attempts thread termination via PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc.
- Polling and delays: controllers use yarp.delay for wait loops (encoders read, motion detection), VisualAttention uses sleep for fixation times, and iSpeakPyCtrl polls the speech server status.
- Port monitoring: helper.PortMonitor runs a reader loop with activation predicate and callback in a worker thread.
- REST notify: iCubRESTManager spawns a thread per subscriber notification to avoid blocking HTTP handler.

## 5.9 Known Code‑Level Issues (from the provided code)

These items can be validated directly against the source:

- Missing import in controllers/position.py: iCubPart.toJSON uses json.dumps but the module does not import json. This will raise NameError when calling toJSON on iCubPart.
- core/ports.py BufferedPort.lastRead does not return the “res” value. It logs but returns None implicitly.
- requests.py uses Thread.isAlive(), which is deprecated/removed in Python 3 (should use is_alive()). _terminate_thread_ may fail on modern interpreters.
- controllers/position.py PositionController.stop sets ref speed to 0.0 per joint but does not invoke a stop command; consider explicit stop if supported by driver.
- Robustness: Forceful thread termination via PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc is unsafe; use cooperative cancellation where possible.
- VisualAttention.__is_safe__: angle bounds are exclusive; boundary values equal to min/max are considered unsafe by design.

These points should be considered during validation and potential remediation.

## 5.10 How to Validate This Mapping

- Instantiate iCub(robot_name) to verify which PositionController instances are valid for the current YARP network; compare against helper._icub_parts_ and helper._position_controllers_.
- Use iCubRESTApp to start the REST server; GET “/<rule_prefix>/<robot_name>” should list the app tree registered in iCubRESTManager; verify helper sub‑APIs are present.
- Trigger GazeController.lookAtFixationPoint and check yarp port activity at “/iKinGazeCtrl”.
- Run actionizer build against a module containing iCubFullbodyAction subclasses; confirm JSON exports match actions.toJSON structure.
- Play an imported action via iCub.playAction and inspect iCubRequestsManager CSV (if logging enabled) or via REST “/pyicub/requests”.

This completes the code‑level view, providing a comprehensive and verifiable mapping from architecture to implementation for all files in the repository.

% 6 — Cross-Cutting Concerns
## 6. Cross-Cutting Concerns

This section identifies and describes cross-cutting concerns implemented across the codebase. It focuses on aspects that affect multiple modules and layers, including logging, configuration, error handling, concurrency, communication, serialization, monitoring, security, and resource management. Each concern is grounded in concrete evidence from the repository to support validation by the development team.

| Concern | Evidence from code | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Logging and diagnostics | pyicub/core/logger.py: _Logger, PyicubLogger, YarpLogger; pyicub/rest.py: PyiCubApp logging configuration via env; widespread usage in controllers, core, modules (e.g., attention.py logger, core/ports.py YarpLogger, requests.py injected logger) | Unified logging facility with two backends: YARP-native logging (YarpLogger) when yarp is available, and Python logging (PyicubLogger) as fallback. PyicubLogger supports configurable formats, file/stream handlers, and levels. PyiCubApp wires logging enablement via environment variables and optionally writes CSV for requests. Modules adhere to injected loggers or local Python loggers for structured diagnostics. |
| Configuration management (environment, CLI, runtime) | pyicub/rest.py: PyiCubApp reads PYICUB_LOGGING, PYICUB_LOGGING_PATH, PYICUB_API, PYICUB_API_RESTMANAGER_HOST/PORT, PYICUB_API_PROXY_HOST/PORT/SCHEME; pyicub/helper.py: ICUB_SIMULATION toggles real vs simulator robot name; pyicub/proc/actionizer.py and pyicub/proc/fsmizer.py use argparse; pyicub/rest.py: PyiCubRESTfulServer exposes utils.configure/getArgs via REST and captures method signatures | Configuration is composed from environment variables (REST enablement, logging, ports, proxy), command-line arguments in process utilities, and REST-level runtime configuration of server apps. Argument signatures for each REST target are exposed to clients to drive dynamic invocation. Simulation mode is controlled via an environment variable. |
| Error handling and timeouts | pyicub/requests.py: iCubRequest status state machine (INIT/RUNNING/TIMEOUT/DONE/FAILED), exception capture and logging, timeout propagation; pyicub/controllers/position.py: DEFAULT_TIMEOUT, waitMotionDone returns False on start/motion timeouts; pyicub/modules/speech.py: path checks with error/ warning logs returning "ERROR"; pyicub/modules/attention.py and pyicub/controllers/gaze.py: warnings on unsafe angles/timeouts | Errors are handled with a combination of explicit checks, structured request lifecycle states, and logging. Operations enforce timeouts (request-level and device-level) and propagate failures. Some user-facing methods intentionally return sentinel strings like "ERROR"; most controller paths favor boolean or status-driven feedback. |
| Concurrency and threading | pyicub/requests.py: ThreadPoolExecutor per request and per request wrapper; cancellation via PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc in iCubRequest._terminate_thread_; pyicub/helper.py: PortMonitor thread; pyicub/modules/attention.py: locks and events for tracking; pyicub/rest.py: Flask threaded=True and notifier threads in notify_subscriber; iCubRESTServer.run_forever retry loop increments port on bind errors | Asynchronous execution is standardized through iCubRequest with thread pools, ensuring time-bound task execution and lifecycle tracking. Additional background threads monitor YARP ports and REST topic notifications. Thread cancellation uses CPython’s async exception injection, which is powerful but potentially unsafe; it is bounded to per-request executors. |
| Communication (YARP IPC) | pyicub/core/ports.py: BufferedReadPort/BufferedWritePort with callbacks and strict mode; pyicub/core/rpc.py: RpcClient wrapper; pyicub/controllers/* uses yarp.PolyDriver and device interfaces; pyicub/modules/* connect to YARP ports (camera, emotions, speech, face, landmarks) | YARP is the primary IPC layer for robot control and perception. Communication wrappers normalize logging and lifecycle management of YARP ports and RPC clients. Controllers leverage iCub standard devices (remote_controlboard, gazecontrollerclient). |
| REST API and remote control | pyicub/rest.py: Flask app, CORS, registration of robots/apps/services; iCubRESTManager.register_target/unregister/subscribe/notify; process_target with async/sync request handling; PyiCubRESTClient utilities; pyicub/proc/icubapi.py: launches iCubRESTApp server | A REST layer exposes robot capabilities and application services with service registration, discovery, and subscription for event-style notifications. Requests may be executed asynchronously (returning a request URL) or synchronously (?sync), mapped to the internal request lifecycle. |
| Serialization and persistence | pyicub/utils.py: importFromJSONFile/exportJSONFile; toJSON methods in actions.py, fsm.py, rest.py DTOs (RESTService, RESTApp, etc.); CSV logging in pyicub/requests.py when enabled | JSON is the canonical format for action/FSM definitions and REST payloads; utilities centralize JSON import/export. When enabled, request executions are persisted as CSV for later analysis. |
| Monitoring, observability, and introspection | pyicub/requests.py: iCubRequest.info() structured metrics; iCubRESTManager endpoints /pyicub/requests, /pyicub/processes, /pyicub/.../<target>/<local_id>; PyiCubRESTClient.get_request_info/is_request_running/wait_until_completed; helper.PortMonitor; controllers verify_encoders | The system exposes run-time request state and timing via REST and programmatic clients. PortMonitor provides application-level signal monitoring and callback invocation. Controllers include validation helpers (e.g., encoder verification) to assess actuation outcomes. |
| Security (authentication, authorization, encryption) | pyicub/rest.py: Flask app with CORS enabled and no authentication or authorization paths; HTTP-only URLs; subscribe/notify endpoints accept external subscriber rules; process_target executes methods based on registry without access control | There is no in-repo implementation of authentication, authorization, or transport encryption. All REST endpoints are open (subject to network reachability), CORS is permissive, and callbacks/notifications trust provided URLs. Deployments must layer external controls (reverse proxy, TLS termination, auth) as this codebase does not provide them. |
| Resource and lifecycle management | Widespread __del__ destructors: core/rpc.RpcClient closes ports; core/ports.BufferedPort closes; modules/camera disconnects and closes buffers; controllers/gaze and position close drivers; pyicub/helper.py: yarp.Network().init()/fini(); iCub.close() stops monitors | YARP device drivers and ports are explicitly closed and disconnected on object teardown. iCub helper finalizer performs a close and network fini. REST manager unregisters services on destruction. This helps prevent stale connections and device locks across runs. |
| Data validation and safety constraints | pyicub/modules/attention.py: __checkRange__/__is_safe__ to gate unsafe head orientations; pyicub/controllers/position.py: assert on SPEED_SCALING bounds and verify_encoders tolerance checks; pyicub/modules/speech.py: file/folder existence and content checks with logs | Safety and validation checks protect hardware and user experience: gaze targets must map to safe joint angles; position control enforces speed scaling constraints and can verify encoder deltas; speech input paths are validated. Violations are logged and operations may be skipped or return failure indications. |
| Timeouts and synchronization semantics | pyicub/controllers/position.py: DEFAULT_TIMEOUT and motion start/motion completion timeouts; pyicub/controllers/gaze.py waitMotionDone/Onset; pyicub/requests.py: TIMEOUT_REQUEST default; REST ?sync parameter to block until completion | Time-bounded control is consistently applied across movement primitives and request execution. REST clients can choose synchronous or asynchronous patterns. Motion primitives detect delayed starts and late completions to mitigate indefinite blocking. |
| Build/run orchestration (CLI) | pyicub/proc/actionizer.py and pyicub/proc/fsmizer.py: argparse-driven build/run to import/export actions/FSMs to JSON repositories | Command-line utilities support offline or scripted generation of action and FSM artifacts, encouraging reproducible setups and separation between authoring and runtime. |
| Testing | No test suite or testing harness present in the repository | There is no explicit unit/functional test implementation detectable in the source tree. Validation relies on runtime checks, logs, and manual or REST-driven inspection. |



% 7 — Quality Attributes and Rationale
## 7. Quality Attributes and Rationale

This section summarizes the key quality attributes demonstrated by the implementation and explains the rationale behind the design choices. All evidence points to concrete classes, methods, and structures present in the codebase so that developers can validate them against the source.

| Quality Attribute | Evidence | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Responsiveness and Concurrency | requests.py: iCubRequest uses concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor and per-request worker threads (run, _execute_), with non-blocking orchestration via iCubRequestsManager.run_request and join_requests. helper.py: moveStep, movePart, moveGaze submit multiple requests and join them. rest.py: process_target delegates to iCubRequestsManager, supporting async and sync via query param ?sync. modules/attention.py: threading.Lock and Event in VisualAttention to coordinate tracking. | Asynchronous execution and request orchestration allow actions (e.g., moving different limbs, gaze, speech) to run in parallel while keeping the main flow responsive. REST endpoints can fire-and-forget or wait for completion, which supports UI and automation use cases without blocking. |
| Robustness and Timeout Handling | requests.py: TIMEOUT_REQUEST, per-request timeouts with status transitions (INIT, RUNNING, TIMEOUT, DONE, FAILED), cancel on timeout. controllers/position.py: waitMotionDone uses multi-phase waiting (motion onset, motion time, extra timeout). controllers/gaze.py: waitMotionDone, waitMotionOnset with speed threshold. modules/speech.py: iSpeakPyCtrl.say polls "stat" until completion. | Defensive waiting with timeouts prevents indefinite blocking on hardware and RPCs. Explicit status and cancellation paths keep the system from stalling if a device or network path becomes unresponsive. |
| Safety (robot motion limits) | modules/attention.py: VisualAttention.__checkRange__ enforces azimuth/elevation/vergence bounds; __is_safe__ maps 3D points to angles via IGazeControl.getAnglesFrom3DPoint and rejects unsafe targets. controllers/gaze.py: blockNeck, blockEyes, clearNeck, clearEyes primitives. | Constraining motion ranges and providing block/clear primitives reduce risk of unsafe head/eye movements. Safety checks are applied before commanding the controller. |
| Reliability of Motion Execution | controllers/position.py: verify_encoders compares actual vs target within tolerance; setPositionControlMode uses yarp.VOCAB_CM_POSITION; getLimits exposes joint limits. SPEED_SCALING bounds and assertion. WAITMOTIONDONE_PERIOD pacing. controllers/gaze.py: explicit motion logging for start, completion, timeout. | Verifying encoder positions, using the correct control mode, and scaling speeds deliberately improve the likelihood of achieving commanded postures reliably and predictably. Detailed logs enable diagnosing deviations. |
| Observability and Diagnostics | core/logger.py: YarpLogger and PyicubLogger with configurable formats and file/stream handlers; global enable/disable. requests.py: request lifecycle logged; CSV audit trail when enabled. rest.py: /pyicub/requests, /pyicub/processes, and per-target request info endpoints; subscriber notifications track enter/exit of operations. controllers/gaze.py and controllers/position.py: rich info/warning logs. | Consistent logging and request auditing provide operational visibility and post-mortem diagnostics. REST endpoints expose runtime state for tooling, dashboards, and tests. |
| Extensibility and Modularity | actions.py: ActionsManager discovers and instantiates iCubFullbodyAction subclasses dynamically via importlib/inspect; iCubActionTemplate parametric JSON generation; JSON import/export across actions and steps. rest.py: PyiCubRESTfulServer registers services using reflection (inspect.signature), supports decorator-based exposure (rest_service), and class-level registration. helper.py: addRuntimeModule allows on-the-fly extension. | Dynamic discovery, JSON-based definitions, and reflective registration make it straightforward to add new behaviors, REST services, and device integrations without altering core execution flows. |
| Interoperability and Integration | core/ports.py and core/rpc.py wrap YARP BufferedPortBottle and RpcClient; modules/speech.py integrates with /iSpeak; modules/llm.py talks to /LLM or /GPT via yarp.RpcClient; modules/camera.py reads from YARP image ports; rest.py provides a Flask-based REST layer, proxying and subscription between apps/robots. | The system bridges YARP (robot middleware) and HTTP REST, allowing both low-latency robot connections and broader system integration with web clients and services. |
| Portability and Runtime Awareness | helper.py and rest.py: ICUB_SIMULATION environment variable toggles icub/icubSim; modules/camera.py chooses camera ports based on robot; core/logger.py gracefully falls back if YARP is missing (PyicubLogger used instead). | Environment-driven configuration and fallbacks allow running on hardware, simulator, or development machines with reduced functionality, improving portability and developer experience. |
| Testability and Reproducibility | actions.py: pervasive toJSON/importFromJSONFile; templates with parameter substitution; FSMs import/export JSON and draw diagrams; modules/speech.py: say_from_folder_rnd uses seeded RNG; controllers/position.py: verify_encoders for post-checks. rest.py: PyiCubRESTfulClient drives FSM and actions via HTTP for black-box tests. | Declarative JSON artifacts, deterministic helpers, and REST clients enable automated and reproducible tests without embedding test logic into controllers. Encoder verification provides a simple assertion mechanism on hardware. |
| Security Considerations | rest.py: CORS enabled; no authentication or authorization; process_target executes registered callables with client-supplied kwargs; remote register/unregister; YARP RPC/ports accept connections without auth. | The system assumes a trusted network (lab environment). Exposure of control surfaces without auth is a deliberate trade-off for ease of integration. Deployments should place the REST server and YARP network behind proper network segmentation or add auth if exposed. |
| Maintainability and Code Quality | Clear separation: controllers, core, modules, proc, REST, FSM, actions; single-responsibility helpers (BufferedPort, RpcClient). Use of Singletons (logger, request manager, helper) to centralize concerns. Notable defects discovered: controllers/position.py.setCustomWaitMotionDone assigns waitMotionDone2 which is not implemented; requests.py._terminate_thread_ uses PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc (unsafe). | Modular packaging and consistent patterns promote maintainability. The identified defects and risky thread termination should be addressed to avoid runtime errors and undefined behavior, improving long-term maintainability. |
| Scalability (lightweight) | rest.py: Flask app runs threaded; iCubRequest uses one thread per target; iCubRequestsManager tracks pending futures; subscriber notifications are offloaded to threads. | This design scales adequately for a lab-scale robot application with tens of concurrent operations. There is no centralized worker pool or backpressure; thus, vertical scaling is limited but acceptable for the domain. |
| Resource Management | Many classes close YARP ports in __del__ (controllers/gaze.py, core/ports.py, core/rpc.py, modules/camera.py). helper.iCub.close stops monitors; rest.iCubRESTServer unsubscribes on shutdown; requests.py unregisters atexit handler for thread pools to control shutdown order. | Systematically releasing device connections and subscribers reduces leaks and eases reconfiguration. Explicit shutdown paths help avoid dangling YARP connections and improve robustness during restarts. |

Overall, the codebase emphasizes responsive non-blocking execution, safe robot motion boundaries, and strong observability, while offering a flexible extension model via JSON artifacts and reflective REST exposure. The main risks are the lack of authentication on the REST/YARP surfaces and the unsafe thread termination path used to cancel long-running targets; both should be mitigated in production deployments.

## 8. Deployment View

This section explains how the software elements in the repository are allocated to runtime infrastructure. It is derived from the codebase and describes the concrete processes, network endpoints, and external dependencies the system binds to at runtime. It focuses on the Python REST process, its interaction with the YARP middleware, and all YARP client/server port connections required to operate iCub hardware or the iCub simulator.

### Deployment artifacts

- Python REST server process
  - Entry point: pyicub/proc/icubapi.py instantiates iCubRESTApp and then calls rest_manager.run_forever(), launching a Flask-based HTTP server (threaded).
  - HTTP routes are rooted at /pyicub and include discovery, registration, subscription, and method invocation endpoints (see Execution environment for details).
  - Services are registered dynamically for a robot name (icub or icubSim based on ICUB_SIMULATION) and an app name (e.g., helper), exposing helper methods and module methods via HTTP.

- Command-line tools
  - Actions packager/runner: pyicub/proc/actionizer.py can “build” JSON from Python action classes or “run” actions from a JSON repository by driving iCub via helper APIs.
  - FSM packager: pyicub/proc/fsmizer.py can “build” JSON FSMs and export their diagrams; it does not start any server.

- YARP-based controllers and modules
  - The iCub helper (pyicub/helper.py) initializes a GazeController and a PositionController per iCub part, each backed by yarp.PolyDriver or yarp ports.
  - Modules bind to specific YARP ports for cameras, speech, emotions, landmarks, and LLM services. All port names and remote endpoints are coded and fixed. The helper lazily instantiates these modules and registers their methods into the REST server if present.

- REST proxy/aggregator (optional)
  - iCubRESTManager supports registration with an upstream REST “proxy” server for service aggregation across nodes. If PYICUB_API_PROXY_HOST and PYICUB_API_PROXY_PORT are set (and differ from the local host/port), the local services register/unregister to the proxy via HTTP.

- Configuration via environment variables
  - ICUB_SIMULATION: when set to 'true', the system uses robot_name = "icubSim" and camera endpoints for the simulator; otherwise "icub".
  - PYICUB_API, PYICUB_API_RESTMANAGER_HOST, PYICUB_API_RESTMANAGER_PORT: enable and configure the REST server host/port.
  - PYICUB_API_PROXY_HOST, PYICUB_API_PROXY_PORT: enable optional proxy registration.
  - PYICUB_LOGGING, PYICUB_LOGGING_PATH: enable application logging and log file path.

- External services required at runtime (provided by the robot stack or other nodes)
  - iKinGazeCtrl YARP server.
  - YARP remote_controlboard servers for all robot parts used (head, face, torso, left_arm, right_arm, left_leg, right_leg).
  - iSpeak speech ports (/iSpeak and /iSpeak/rpc) or /<robot>/speech:rpc for speechPyCtrl.
  - /<robot>/face/emotions/in and /<robot>/face/raw/in for face/emotions control.
  - Camera image streams (icubSim: /icubSim/cam/<side>/rgbImage:o; icub: /icub/camcalib/<side>/out).
  - Face landmarks publishers (/faceLandmarks/landmarks:o and /faceLandmarks/faces:o).
  - Optional LLM YARP RPC servers at /LLM/rpc:i or /GPT/rpc:i.

Notes:
- PositionController local port prefix pattern is determined by the OS process ID and robot name: /pyicub/<pid>/<robot>/<part_name>.
- All YARP connections are established using yarp.Network.connect (for Buffered*Ports) or yarp.PolyDriver (for device clients).
- yarp.Network().init() is invoked in multiple modules (attention.py, helper.py) to ensure YARP network initialization within the process.

### Execution environment

- Process model
  - A single Python process typically hosts both the REST server (Flask via iCubRESTManager) and the iCub helper instance. The REST server runs threaded, and request execution is delegated to per-call ThreadPoolExecutor workers managed by iCubRequestsManager. Additional short-lived threads are used for notifications and subscription callbacks.

- HTTP endpoints (served by the REST manager)
  - Root: "/" returns package info; "/pyicub" lists robots; "/pyicub/tree" shows the registered app/service tree.
  - Registration and subscription: "/pyicub/register", "/pyicub/unregister", "/pyicub/subscribe", "/pyicub/unsubscribe", "/pyicub/subscribers", "/pyicub/notify" support cross-node aggregation and eventing.
  - Service invocation: "/pyicub/<robot>/<app>/<target>" accepts POST (and GET for metadata). If ?sync is present, the server waits until the underlying request completes; otherwise it returns a URL to poll the request status.

- YARP runtime
  - The process initializes YARP and hosts multiple client-side YARP ports and PolyDrivers. It connects to pre-existing remote YARP servers provided by the robot stack or simulator.
  - No YARP servers are started by this codebase; all remote ports must already be available on the network under the exact names used in the table above.

- Robot selection and cameras
  - When ICUB_SIMULATION='true', the system assumes "icubSim" and uses camera streams /icubSim/cam/<side>/rgbImage:o.
  - Otherwise "icub" is assumed, using /icub/camcalib/<side>/out streams.

- External services over YARP
  - Gaze: /iKinGazeCtrl must be reachable.
  - Controlboards: /<robot>/(head|face|torso|left_arm|right_arm|left_leg|right_leg) must be reachable for the joints used.
  - Speech: either /<robot>/speech:rpc (speechPyCtrl) or /iSpeak and /iSpeak/rpc (iSpeakPyCtrl).
  - Emotions and face raw: /<robot>/face/emotions/in and /<robot>/face/raw/in.
  - Face landmarks: /faceLandmarks/landmarks:o and /faceLandmarks/faces:o publishers.
  - LLM: /LLM/rpc:i or /GPT/rpc:i (YARP RPC servers).

- Python dependencies (as imported in code)
  - yarp (Python bindings), Flask, flask_cors, requests, transitions, numpy, logging. The system relies on these to start the REST server, run FSMs, and process numeric operations.

- Logging
  - YarpLogger is used when yarp is present; otherwise PyicubLogger falls back to Python logging. PYICUB_LOGGING[=_path] governs log emission and optional file logging.

### Dependencies between nodes

- REST clients depend on the Flask server reachable at http://<host>:<port>/pyicub (host/port controlled by PYICUB_API_RESTMANAGER_HOST/PORT, with firstAvailablePort selection on conflicts). Clients invoke targets under /pyicub/<robot>/<app>/<target>.

- The REST server depends on the iCub helper instance to fulfill “helper” app endpoints. The helper, in turn, depends on successfully created YARP PolyDrivers and port connections for gaze and position control, as well as on-demand modules (speech, emotions, face, camera, landmarks, attention, LLM).

- The YARP client ports in this process depend on the exact remote YARP servers:
  - GazeController → /iKinGazeCtrl.
  - PositionController per part → /<robot>/(head|face|torso|left_arm|right_arm|left_leg|right_leg).
  - Emotions → /<robot>/face/emotions/in; Face raw → /<robot>/face/raw/in.
  - Speech (mode 1) → /<robot>/speech:rpc; Speech (mode 2) → /iSpeak and /iSpeak/rpc.
  - Face landmarks → /faceLandmarks/landmarks:o and /faceLandmarks/faces:o.
  - Cameras → /icubSim/cam/<side>/rgbImage:o or /icub/camcalib/<side>/out.
  - LLM → /LLM/rpc:i or /GPT/rpc:i.

- Optional proxy dependency: when configured as a non-proxy node, the local REST manager registers/unregisters its services with a remote proxy at http://PYICUB_API_PROXY_HOST:PYICUB_API_PROXY_PORT/pyicub, which then acts as an aggregator for discovery and delegation.

- FSM subscribers (if used) depend on the publisher’s REST /pyicub/notify endpoint for event callbacks. The subscriber registers via REST and receives asynchronous enter/exit notifications executed by threads within the publisher process.

This deployment view is fully determined by the source code: the single Python process hosts both the HTTP control plane and the YARP data/control plane, and it binds to the specific YARP and HTTP endpoints listed.

# Section 8.1 — Deployment Diagram

This section describes the concrete runtime deployment of the PyiCub system as implemented in the codebase. It focuses on processes, hosts, and external dependencies, and on how components interact over YARP and HTTP. The diagram reflects actual port names, devices, and endpoints used by the code, including the Flask-based REST API, YARP PolyDrivers/ports, and external YARP services such as gaze control, robot part control boards, TTS (iSpeak), face landmarks, and LLM RPC servers. The robot side can be either a physical iCub or the simulator (icubSim), selected via the ICUB_SIMULATION environment variable.

Figure 8.1 — PyiCub Deployment Diagram

![diagram_009_46c59faa3f](diagram_009_46c59faa3f.png)

The Application Host runs the Flask-based REST layer (iCubRESTApp and iCubRESTManager) and the iCub helper runtime. The helper connects via YARP to robot-side control boards and services. Camera sources depend on whether ICUB_SIMULATION enables icubSim; accordingly, camera endpoints switch between /icub/camcalib/<side>/out and /icubSim/cam/<side>/rgbImage:o. The REST manager may optionally register to a proxy aggregator; when not configured, it operates standalone. The REST API host and port are determined from environment variables, with port selection using the firstAvailablePort utility.
