# SECTION 1 — System Overview

This section introduces the purpose, scope, and main capabilities of the system as implemented in the repository. It is derived strictly from the source code and is intended to be understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. No diagrams are included in this section.

The system implements an Urban Digital Twin for road traffic, combining FIWARE-based context management with a SUMO-based traffic simulator. It ingests real-world open data, preprocesses it to align with a SUMO network, emulates physical sensing through a Mobility Virtual Environment, registers and streams measurements via a FIWARE IoT Agent to Orion-LD, maintains NGSI-LD entities in a Context Broker, subscribes those entities to QuantumLeap for time-series storage in TimescaleDB, and orchestrates SUMO simulations that can be calibrated against observed flows. A Django web application provides user-facing pages to list and inspect entities, configure and run calibrations, and review results with summary metrics and links to dashboards.

## Purpose and Main Functionalities

The system’s purpose is to create a calibrated, data-driven digital twin of urban traffic flows. It operationalizes a continuous loop in which real-world traffic loop measurements are mapped to network edges, sent as NGSI-LD device measurements, reflected as domain entities (Road, RoadSegment, TrafficFlowObserved), persisted historically, and used to configure, calibrate, simulate, and evaluate traffic scenarios in SUMO.

Key functionalities evidenced in the codebase include:

- Data preprocessing pipeline to:
  - Filter raw open data by sensor accuracy thresholds and dates.
  - Enrich records with spatial zones, detector coordinates, and SUMO edge identifiers.
  - Export TAZ (zones) to SUMO, map detectors to lanes, and generate edge-based XML inputs for simulations.
  - Produce Digital Shadow seed data (shadow types) for later entity mapping.

- Mobility Virtual Environment to emulate the physical system:
  - Set up “roads” and “traffic loop” sensor devices from preprocessed CSVs.
  - Register IoT Agent service groups and devices (type Device) with appropriate attributes.
  - Stream “trafficFlow” measurements (with location, timeSlot, laneDirection, dateObserved, taz) to the IoT Agent South port and update the Context Broker.

- FIWARE context and time-series integration:
  - NGSI-LD entity management with Road, RoadSegment, and TrafficFlowObserved types via ngsildclient.
  - Digital shadow matching to derive Road metadata (name, edgeID, start/end points) for consistent NGSI-LD updates.
  - Subscriptions from Orion-LD to QuantumLeap for targeted attributes (trafficFlow).
  - Time-series storage and querying from TimescaleDB for historical flows.

- SUMO-based traffic simulation and calibration:
  - Route generation from edge-based counts, scenario setup, and simulation execution via libtraci.
  - Macroscopic modeling per edge and time slot (Greenshield, Underwood, Van Aerde) and calibration against SUMO outputs.
  - Support for multiple car-following models (Krauss, IDM, W99) with tunable parameters (e.g., tau, sigma, delta, cc1/cc2).
  - Error and performance evaluation (RMSE, MAPE, R2, GEH, normalized metrics) and summary metrics across runs.

- Web application for interaction and reporting:
  - Entity list and detail views backed by MongoDB “entities” (Orion-LD store).
  - Simulation modeler form to run calibrations with chosen models, parameters, dates, and time windows.
  - Results pages with mean error tables, summary trip metrics, and integration hooks to Grafana dashboards.

## High-Level Scope

The repository implements the full end-to-end system:

- Ingestion and preprocessing of open traffic flow data into a SUMO-aligned form.
- Emulation of device measurements and real-time context updates in FIWARE.
- Time-series subscriptions and historical queries.
- SUMO scenario generation, execution, calibration, and evaluation.
- A UI for monitoring, model calibration, and results inspection.

External systems assumed by the implementation include FIWARE Orion-LD, FIWARE IoT Agent (JSON), QuantumLeap, TimescaleDB, MongoDB, and Eclipse SUMO (with tools and libtraci available on the host). Paths and ports are driven by code-level constants and environment files.

## Key Features Observable from the Codebase

- Preprocessing and data products:
  - Accuracy filtering, date range filtering, dataset reordering.
  - Zone enrichment using custom geoshapes; export of TAZ as SUMO additional file.
  - Detector coordinate extraction and mapping to lanes; induction loop export.
  - SUMO edge ID assignment to roads; generation of edgedata.xml per time slot from real flows.
  - Digital shadow seed CSV: “digital_shadow_types.csv” for road and traffic loop shadows.

- FIWARE integration:
  - IoT Agent interactions for service groups and device registration, plus measurement sending to South port.
  - Orion-LD context operations creating/updating:
    - Road (with BolognaRoadName).
    - RoadSegment (startPoint, endPoint, location, direction, taz, edgeID, trafficFlow, timeslot, DateTime).
    - TrafficFlowObserved (laneDirection, trafficFlow, timeslot, DateTime, relations to RoadSegment).
  - Subscriptions to QuantumLeap on selected entity types and attributes for historical persistence.

- Digital shadowing:
  - On-demand shadow creation/matching for “road” and “trafficLoop” using spatial and device keys.
  - Shadow persistence to CSV per shadow name, supporting reusability in the same runtime.

- Simulation orchestration:
  - Route generation: randomTrips and routeSampler from SUMO tools.
  - Macroscopic model generation and per-edge parameters from observed flows.
  - Batch execution across time slots, parameter sweeps for car-following models, and collection of SUMO outputs.
  - Error computation and summarization (speed, density, flow; RMSE, MAPE, MAE, R2, NRMSE/NMAE; GEH).

- Web backend and UX:
  - Django application (FlowTwin) with views for monitoring, entity list/detail, model calibration (forms), and result summaries.
  - Entity browsing over MongoDB “entities” (orion-openiot).
  - Results pages that read model parameter JSON, mean errors, and mean trip metrics; embeds or links for Grafana dashboards.

| libraries/constants.py | constants | Centralized file paths, model contexts/types (Smart Data Models URIs), SUMO paths and tools paths. |
| udtBackEnd/udtApp/views.py | Django Views | Renders Home/Monitor pages; lists NGSI-LD entities from MongoDB (Device Document); runs simulation calibration pipeline (DigitalTwinManager) via POST form; exposes results summary view reading outputs (JSON/CSV) and embedding Grafana. |
| udtBackEnd/udtApp/models.py | Django Models (SQL) and MongoEngine Documents | SQL models for migrations; the runtime uses MongoEngine Device document bound to collection “entities” in db “orion-openiot”. |
| udtBackEnd/udtApp/forms.py | ConfigForm | Collects model parameters (macromodel, car-following, tau, additional params), time window, and date; performs validation. |

| data/preprocessing/preprocessingSetup.py | run() | Orchestrates preprocessing sequence by invoking preprocessingUtils functions and saving outputs. |

Notes for validation:
- All HTTP endpoints and NGSI-LD operations reflected in the diagram are present in the code (Agent for IoT Agent north/south, Broker via ngsildclient to Orion-LD, SubscriptionManager creating subscriptions to QuantumLeap).
- Historical data access for scenario generation is implemented via TimescaleManager against the “quantumleap” database.
- SUMO integration uses libtraci (runtime) and tools scripts (randomTrips.py, routeSampler.py, detector/mapDetectors.py).
- MongoDB access is present in both the emulation path (processingTlData) and the Django UI (Device document in collection “entities”).
- Grafana dashboards are embedded in templates and expected to read from TimescaleDB; no back-channel writes occur in code.

% 5 — Code-Level View
# Section 5 — Code-Level View

This section describes how the implemented architecture maps onto the source code. It identifies the executable entry points, the key modules and directories, and any explicit architectural or design patterns observable from the code. It provides a code-to-component inventory that can be validated by the development team and used to navigate and evolve the system.

## 5.1 Purpose and Scope

The goal is to make the architecture concrete by linking responsibilities, runtime behaviors, and deployment aspects to the actual code artifacts. This includes the end-to-end data path from data preprocessing, through emulated physical system and FIWARE interactions, to simulation/calibration and the web backend for monitoring and summarizing results.

## 5.2 Main Entry Points

This system exposes three primary execution contexts:

1) Interactive CLI orchestrator  
- File: main.py  
- Class: TerminalSystem  
- Role: Initializes FIWARE connections (IoT Agent, Orion-LD, QuantumLeap), sets up subscriptions, configures TimescaleDB connectivity and SUMO environment, and orchestrates:
  - Preprocessing pipeline: data.preprocessing.preprocessingSetup.run()
  - Physical system emulator: mobilityvenv.MobilityVirtualEnvironment.setupPhysicalSystem() and startPhysicalSystem()
  - Calibration and simulation: libraries.classes.DigitalTwinManager.DigitalTwinManager.configureCalibrateAndRun()
- Behavior: Presents a CLI loop; alternatively executes a “legacy main” sequence configuring multiple simulation configurations batch-wise.

2) Web backend (Django)  
- Project: udtBackEnd  
- Process entry points: udtBackEnd/udtBackEnd/wsgi.py and udtBackEnd/udtBackEnd/asgi.py  
- Development server runner: udtBackEnd/manage.py  
- Views: udtBackEnd/udtApp/views.py exposes routes to list entities (MongoDB), start simulations (form-backed), and render results and summaries.

3) Preprocessing task  
- File: data/preprocessing/preprocessingSetup.py  
- Function: run()  
- Role: Builds derived datasets for the rest of the system (filtering, enrichment, SUMO mapping, detector generation, traffic flow extraction, edge mapping) using functions in libraries.utils.preprocessingUtils and constants in libraries.constants.

- Layered organization (explicit in code structure):
  - Data ingestion and preprocessing (libraries.utils.* and data/preprocessing/*)
  - Device/emulation adapter layer (mobilityvenv/*, libraries/classes/Agent.py)
  - Context management and domain model mapping (libraries/classes/Broker.py, DigitalShadowManager.py)
  - Persistence adapters (libraries/classes/DataManager.py, TimescaleManager, MongoDBManager)
  - Simulation layer (libraries/classes/{Planner,TrafficModeler,SumoSimulator,DigitalTwinManager}.py)
  - Presentation layer (udtBackEnd Django app, MTV pattern)

- Adapter/Facade:
  - Agent encapsulates IoT Agent HTTPs; Broker encapsulates ngsildclient; DataManager/TImescaleManager wrap DB access; ScenarioGenerator encapsulates SUMO tools.

- Observer/Callback:
  - Sensor.setDataCallback() → Agent.retrievingData(); libtraci StepListener (ValueListener) pattern registered in SumoSimulator.

- Builder (via external lib):
  - SubscriptionBuilder from ngsildclient used to build Orion-LD subscriptions.

- MVC/MTV (Django):
  - Models (Mongoengine Document + unmanaged SQL table), Templates, Views, URL routing.

## 5.6 External Dependencies Evident in Code

- FIWARE: Orion-LD via ngsildclient, IoT Agent JSON (HTTP), QuantumLeap subscriptions (HTTP).
- Databases: TimescaleDB via psycopg2, MongoDB via mongoengine/pymongo.
- SUMO stack: libtraci, sumolib, SUMO tools (randomTrips.py, routeSampler.py, detector tools).
- Data science/GIS: pandas, numpy, scipy, geopandas, shapely, matplotlib.
- Imaging: PIL.
- Web: Django.

All external calls and file paths are parameterized in libraries/constants.py and by environment variables loaded through libraries.utils.generalUtils.loadEnvVar().

## 5.7 Notes for Validation

- The linkage between measurementSending() and Broker.updateContext() is explicit and guarded by success status codes and exception raising.  
- Road/RoadSegment/TrafficFlowObserved entity types and relationships are created and updated as per ngsildclient usage in Broker.py.  
- DigitalShadowManager.searchShadow() defers to data-driven CSV lookups and lazily creates shadows; errors propagate via RuntimeError/ValueError and are surfaced in Broker.updateContext().  
- TimescaleManager.retrieveHistoricalDataForTimeslot() queries are parameterized and return pandas DataFrames consistent with Planner expectations.  
- The Django views instantiate the same classes as main.py (Simulator, DigitalTwinManager, TimescaleManager) to drive server-side simulations, and store params.json alongside computed CSV/JSON artifacts.

This code-level view directly mirrors the implementation, allowing a reviewer to trace responsibilities and interactions from files to runtime behaviors without ambiguity.

% 5.1 — Class Diagram
# SECTION 5.1 — Class Diagram

This section presents the complete static structure of the codebase as a PlantUML class diagram. It is derived directly from the source code and shows all classes, their attributes where relevant, inheritance, and key associations and aggregations among components. The diagram is organized by logical packages reflecting the project’s directory structure to support validation by developers familiar with the code.

Figure 5.1 — Class Diagram

![diagram_003_a8f65665a8](diagram_003_a8f65665a8.png)

Notes on the diagram

The diagram depicts all classes defined in the repository with their relationships:

- The Agent aggregates a Broker and an ngsildclient Client to manage device registration and measurement forwarding, and it updates the Context Broker via Broker.updateContext.

- The Broker composes a DigitalShadowManager to resolve road shadows and orchestrates NGSI-LD entities using ngsildclient types (Client, Entity, Rel). Specific exception types specialize ContextUpdateError to pinpoint errors per entity category.

- The DataManager aggregates database managers. TimescaleManager and MongoDBManager derive from DBManager and expose their respective connections (psycopg2 and pymongo).

- The DigitalShadowManager composes a ShadowDataProcessor and manages a collection of Shadow objects persisted to CSV.

- The DigitalTwinManager composes a Simulator, a Planner, and uses the DataManager and TrafficModeler to calibrate and run simulations.

- The Planner orchestrates scenario generation through ScenarioGenerator, which in turn uses the Simulator.

- The Simulator registers a ValueListener (a libtraci StepListener) and provides APIs for SUMO execution, telemetry, and TLS control.

- In the mobility virtual environment, PhysicalSystemConnector aggregates Sensors (which extend Device). Sensors push data via a callback bound to Agent.retrievingData.

- The Django app contains a ConfigForm (extends forms.Form), UdtappConfig (extends AppConfig), and MongoEngine/Django models for Timescale, Mongo, and device entities. Names identical to classes in libraries (e.g., Simulator, Device) are namespaced by package and do not conflict.

- TerminalSystem (main.py) wires all runtime components: Agent, Broker, QuantumLeapManager, TimescaleManager, DataManager, Simulator, Planner, and DigitalTwinManager. The associations shown reflect actual attributes in TerminalSystem’s initializer.

This class diagram can be validated against the code by verifying class names, attributes, and method signatures, as well as imports and composition patterns present in the repository.

% 6 — Cross-Cutting Concerns
## 6. Cross-Cutting Concerns

This section identifies system-wide concerns that cut across multiple modules and layers. It records how the current codebase implements or omits security, logging, configuration, error handling, testing, and monitoring, with precise evidence to support validation by the development team.

| Concern | Evidence from code | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Authentication | libraries/classes/Agent.py: serviceGroupRegistration(), measurementRegistration(), measurementSending() use FIWARE IoT Agent API keys; mobilityvenv/PhysicalSystemConnector.py: saveConnectedDevice() persists device keys; udtBackEnd/udtBackEnd/settings.py uses hardcoded SECRET_KEY; libraries/classes/DataManager.py TimescaleManager() uses hardcoded DB credentials | Authentication toward FIWARE IoT Agent relies on an API key (apikey) and per-device key passed in URL query (k=...), with no token-based auth. MongoDB connects without credentials. Django SECRET_KEY and PostgreSQL credentials are hardcoded, indicating development-mode practices. |
| Authorization | No role/permission checks in any service integration; requests to IoT Agent and Context Broker use tenant headers only (fiware-service, fiware-servicepath) | There is no explicit authorization layer in the application code. Access control is delegated to FIWARE components if configured; the code itself does not enforce roles/permissions. |
| Transport encryption | All external HTTP calls are plain http:// (e.g., Agent → IoT Agent: http://{host}:{port}/iot/...; Broker → Orion-LD via ngsildclient hostname/port without TLS); Django templates embed http Grafana iframes | No TLS is enforced for external communications (IoT Agent, Orion-LD, QuantumLeap, Grafana, TimescaleDB, MongoDB). Connections and credentials traverse plaintext channels. |
| Secrets management | udtBackEnd/udtBackEnd/settings.py: SECRET_KEY literal; DataManager.TimescaleManager.dbConnect() embeds postgres://...; PhysicalSystemConnector.saveConnectedDevice() writes device_id and device_key to CSV under registereddevices/; libraries/utils/generalUtils.generate_random_key() generates keys but no vaulting | Secrets and credentials are stored in code and on disk in plaintext (CSV). The .env reader (generalUtils.loadEnvVar) is used for FIWARE ports only, not for secrets. There is no secret rotation or encryption at rest. |
| Configuration management | libraries/constants.py centralizes file paths, data model URIs, and tool paths (Windows-specific SUMO_TOOLS_PATH); libraries/utils/generalUtils.loadEnvVar() loads fiwareenv/.env used by main.py and views.simulationModeler(); udtBackEnd/udtBackEnd/settings.py appends a fixed Windows path to sys.path | Mixed configuration sources: a constants module for paths and model URIs, a custom .env loader for FIWARE port values, and hardcoded OS-specific paths. This impacts portability (Windows-specific) and deployability. |
| Error handling and resilience | libraries/classes/Broker.py defines ContextUpdateError and specializations; updateContext() wraps flow with granular exceptions and returns False on failure; Agent.measurementSending() catches requests errors and raises; TrafficModeler.evaluateModel() and preprocessing utils catch and continue on file/parse errors; widespread prints instead of structured handling | Exceptions are defined and sometimes propagated; in other cases, functions print and return False, which can hide failures. There is no unified error policy or retry/backoff for remote calls and subprocesses. |
| Logging and tracing | Extensive use of print() across modules (Broker.updateFlow() prints JSON entity payloads; preprocessingUtils prints status; SumoSimulator prints state transitions); Django logging not configured; libtraci.start() writes traceFile but not integrated | No standard Python logging is configured. There is no log level control, correlation IDs, or centralized aggregation. Diagnostics for external tool invocations (subprocess) are often suppressed (stdout/stderr redirected to DEVNULL in Planner.generateRoute). |
| Input validation and unsafe eval | forms.ConfigForm.clean() validates time ranges; DataManager.TimescaleManager.retrieveHistoricalDataForTimeslot() guards parameters; Planner/ScenarioGenerator validate inputs/files; preprocessingUtils.addZones() and exportZonesToSUMO() use eval() to parse Geo Shape fields | Most inputs have basic validation, but the use of eval() on CSV content in preprocessing creates a code injection risk. Replace eval with safe JSON parsing (json.loads) for Geo Shape values. |
| Monitoring and observability | libraries/classes/SubscriptionManager.py: QuantumLeapManager.createQuantumLeapSubscription() sets Orion-LD subscriptions for trafficFlow on RoadSegment, TrafficFlowObserved, Device; Django templates (entity.html, monitor.html, summary.html) embed Grafana dashboards; libraries/utils/statisticUtils.py compute_mean_tripinfo_metrics(), evaluateSimulationError(); libraries/classes/SumoSimulator.py exposes detector summaries | Time-series persistence and dashboards are present via QuantumLeap + TimescaleDB + Grafana. Simulation KPIs and error metrics are computed and persisted. There is no health-check/heartbeat instrumentation, nor metrics export (e.g., Prometheus) for the Python services. |
| External process execution and safety | Planner.ScenarioGenerator.generateRoutes() and generateRoute() invoke SUMO tools via subprocess; TrafficModeler calls ET.parse on tool outputs; DigitalTwinManager runs SUMO simulations via libtraci without external watchdogs | External tool calls lack timeouts and robust error handling; some invocations suppress stderr/stdout, hampering diagnostics. Long-running SUMO processes rely on libtraci without circuit breakers. |
| Testing | udtBackEnd/udtApp/tests.py is empty; no unit or integration tests for core services (Agent, Broker, DigitalShadowManager, preprocessing pipeline) | Automated testing is absent. Behavior is validated manually via the web UI and ad-hoc scripts. Adding tests for data preprocessing, shadow matching, entity updates, and route generation would improve reliability. |

% 7 — Quality Attributes and Rationale
## 7. Quality Attributes and Rationale

This section summarizes the key quality attributes that are explicitly supported by the implementation. For each attribute, we provide concrete evidence from the codebase and explain the design rationale implied by structure, patterns, and comments. The goal is to make these claims verifiable by developers familiar with the code.

| Quality Attribute | Evidence | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interoperability (FIWARE NGSI-LD, IoT Agent, QuantumLeap, SUMO) | Broker uses ngsildclient and Smart Data Models (e.g., TRANSPORTATION_DATA_MODEL_CTX, ROAD_SEGMENT_DATA_MODEL_TYPE); Agent registers devices and sends measurements to IoT Agent via /iot/services and /iot/devices; SubscriptionManager creates subscriptions to QuantumLeap; constants define NGSI-LD types/contexts; SUMO integrated via libtraci, sumolib and SUMO tools. | The system bridges real-time IoT ingestion (IoT Agent), context management (Orion-LD), time-series persistence (QuantumLeap/TimescaleDB), and traffic simulation (SUMO). Explicit use of NGSI-LD models and context URIs ensures semantic alignment with FIWARE Smart Data Models. |
| Performance (simulation throughput) | Planner.generateRoute passes "--threads 8" to routeSampler.py; SumoSimulator uses libtraci (native step loop); TrafficModeler precomputes models edge-by-edge; preprocessing uses vectorized Pandas and SciPy cKDTree. | Multi-threaded route sampling, native SUMO stepping, and vectorized preprocessing reduce compute latency in scenario generation and model evaluation. |
| Maintainability (modularity, clarity) | Clear separation of concerns: Agent, Broker, DigitalShadowManager, DigitalTwinManager, Planner, Simulator, TrafficModeler, DataManager; constants centralized in libraries/constants.py; extensive type hints; domain-specific exceptions in Broker (ContextUpdateError hierarchy). | The decomposition and explicit types simplify reasoning, change impact, and onboarding. Custom exceptions localize error semantics for road, segment, and observed flow operations. |
| Reliability and Robustness (defensive checks) | Widespread input validation and guards: checks for file/path existence (Planner.setScenario, SumoSimulator path setters); try/except with explicit messages (Broker.createConnection/updateContext, Agent.measurementSending); deduplication and correction in preprocessing (mapDetectorsFromCoordinates duplicate removal; fillMissingDirections; fillMissingEdgeId). | Defensive programming and explicit failure handling maintain system continuity across external dependencies (files, network, SUMO), while preprocessing enforces consistency before analytics/simulation. |
| Data Quality and Consistency | preprocessingUtils.filterWithAccuracy enforces minimum accuracy; addZones assigns and imputes missing zones via spatial containment and nearest centroid (cKDTree); linkEdgeId joins edge IDs; exportZonesToSUMO ensures SUMO TAZ consistency; reorderDataset and filteringDataset order and constrain data temporally. | The pipeline explicitly curates open data for quality, completeness, and alignment with the SUMO network, which is crucial for reliable calibration and credible simulation outcomes. |
| Observability and Monitoring | Django UI exposes entities and a monitor page; templates embed Grafana dashboards; statisticUtils computes mean TripInfo metrics and error summaries (RMSE, NRMSE, MAPE, GEH) persisted to CSV/JSON; TrafficModeler writes per-edge detected vs. real metrics. | The system provides both operational dashboards (Grafana) and quantitative evaluation artifacts (CSV/JSON) to observe, diagnose, and compare model behavior over time. |
| Testability (injection and seams) | DigitalTwinManager accepts external Simulator and DataManager; Planner receives Simulator; DataManager composes DB managers; Agent defers Broker connection creation; most side-effects contained in class methods. | Constructor injection and late-binding of external collaborators enable isolation in tests and facilitate mocking of network/simulation dependencies. |
| Extensibility (models and parameters) | TrafficModeler supports multiple macroscopic models (greenshield, underwood, vanaerde) and multiple car-following models (Krauss, IDM, W99) with pluggable parameters; DigitalTwinManager.configureCalibrateAndRun loops over timeslots and persists model artifacts per configuration; DataManager supports multiple DB backends via addDBManager. | New models, parameters, or DB backends can be introduced with localized changes, preserving existing flows. The calibration loop is designed to scale across time ranges and edges. |
| Scalability (data and scenario generation) | Planner.scenarioGenerator supports large vehicle counts via routeSampler; generateEdgeDataFile and evaluate routines iterate across all edges and hours; QuantumLeap subscriptions are defined per entity type; ngsildclient query_generator used for entity iteration. | The system scales by delegating heavy-lift tasks to SUMO tools and time-series backends, while iterating by type/edge/hour to avoid monolithic processing. |
| Fault Handling and Recovery Cues | Agent.measurementSending catches requests errors and raises explicit messages; Broker.updateContext returns False on failures and logs messages; DigitalShadowManager.searchShadow falls back to creating shadows; preprocessing scripts continue on missing or malformed rows with informative prints. | The code favors graceful degradation and explicit diagnostics instead of silent failures, aiding operational recovery when upstream components are unavailable or data is inconsistent. |
| Security (transport and credentials — current state) | IoT Agent calls include fiware-service headers and per-device API keys (generate_random_key); .env-based port configuration via loadEnvVar. | Basic tenant scoping and device API keys are present; however, the code currently uses HTTP, default DB credentials and local hosts, indicating a development posture rather than hardened security. |
| Portability (current constraints) | Hard-coded Windows paths for SUMO tools (e.g., SUMO_TOOLS_PATH set to "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Eclipse\\Sumo\\tools"); Django settings sys.path with absolute Windows paths; views use absolute Windows BASE_DIR. | The project runs on a Windows-based environment as-is. Portability to Linux/macOS would require externalizing paths and removing OS-specific assumptions. |
| Usability (operator workflow) | Django forms (ConfigForm) with validation (time range, parameter bounds), dynamic fields by model, toast notifications; templates for listing entities with pagination and filtering; simulation results summarized in a single page. | Operators can configure, run, and inspect simulations through a guided UI, reducing the need to invoke scripts manually and lowering error likelihood in parameterization. |

% 8 — Deployment View
## 8. Deployment View

This section describes how the software elements in the repository are allocated to infrastructure elements and external services, based strictly on the artifacts and runtime assumptions visible in the source code. It clarifies what processes run where, which external systems are expected, the configuration artifacts that bind them, and the operational dependencies between runtime nodes.

### Deployment artifacts

- Application entry points and server runtimes
  - Main CLI orchestrator: main.py (class TerminalSystem orchestrates preprocessing, IoT integration, calibration, and simulation).
  - Django web application: udtBackEnd/ (WSGI in udtBackEnd/udtBackEnd/wsgi.py, ASGI in udtBackEnd/udtBackEnd/asgi.py, manage.py to runserver).
  - Django app: udtBackEnd/udtApp/ (views, urls, templates, forms, migrations).

- Configuration sources and constants
  - Environment file path expected at libraries/constants.CONTAINER_ENV_FILE_PATH → fiwareenv/.env (contains IOTA_NORTH_PORT, IOTA_SOUTH_PORT, ORIONLD_PORT, TIMESCALE_DB_PORT, QUANTUMLEAP_PORT; loaded by libraries/utils/generalUtils.loadEnvVar).
  - Centralized paths and model constants in libraries/constants.py (SUMO_PATH, SUMO_TOOLS_PATH, SUMO_NET_PATH, data directories, Smart Data Models context/type IRIs).
  - Django settings in udtBackEnd/udtBackEnd/settings.py:
    - MongoDB connection via mongoengine.connect(db='orion-openiot', host='localhost', port=27017).
    - TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL) connection profile in DATABASES['timescale'].
    - sys.path customization to "C:/Users/manfr/PycharmProjects/IntelliFlowTwin" for module resolution (environment-specific).
    - Static files configuration.

- Data and file-system layouts (read/write at runtime)
  - SUMO working tree under SUMO_PATH = <project>/sumoenv with subfolders:
    - static/ (full.net.xml, detectors.add.xml, output/, TAZ additional files).
    - routes/ (generated by Planner/ScenarioGenerator).
    - output/ (simulation outputs).
    - standalone/ (configuration and logs for standalone runs).
  - Preprocessing inputs/outputs under data/:
    - Opendata inputs under data/realworlddata/opendata/ (CSV files; must exist at runtime).
    - Generated outputs under data/preprocessing/generated/ (processed_traffic_flow.csv, edgedata.xml, road_names.csv, flow/model/daily files).
    - Digital shadow data under data/digitalshadow/.
  - Simulation result folders (created by DigitalTwinManager/TrafficModeler) under SUMO_PATH, including per-configuration folders with params.json, mean_errors.csv, mean_tripinfo_metrics.json, and plots.

- External executables and toolchains invoked
  - SUMO binaries: sumo and sumo-gui (invoked by libraries/classes/SumoSimulator via libtraci).
  - SUMO Tools scripts:
    - randomTrips.py and routeSampler.py (Planner.ScenarioGenerator, DigitalTwinManager).
    - detector/mapDetectors.py and detector/edgeDataFromFlow.py (preprocessingUtils).
  - libtraci and traci constants expected in Python environment.

- Database-level artifacts (as used by the code)
  - TimescaleDB (quantumleap database) tables referenced by TimescaleManager:
    - "mtopeniot"."ethttps://smartdatamodels.org/datamodel.transportation/roadsegm".
    - "mtopeniot"."ethttps://smartdatamodels.org/datamodel.transportation/trafficf".
    - "mtopeniot".etdevice.
  - Views created programmatically (TimescaleManager.createView) to expose those tables as views under schema mtopeniot.
  - MongoDB collection: 'entities' (Device Document model) in database 'orion-openiot'.

- Programmatic FIWARE subscriptions and registrations
  - Orion-LD subscriptions created by libraries/classes/SubscriptionManager.QuantumLeapManager with notification URL http://fiware-quantumleap:{QUANTUMLEAP_PORT}/v2/notify for:
    - RoadSegment (trafficFlow).
    - TrafficFlowObserved (trafficFlow).
    - Device (trafficFlow).
  - IoT Agent service-group and device registrations performed by libraries/classes/Agent against IoT Agent north/south endpoints.

### Execution environment

- Operating system and file paths
  - The repository assumes a Windows host for SUMO tools based on SUMO_TOOLS_PATH = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Eclipse\Sumo\tools" and multiple absolute Windows paths in Django settings and views (e.g., serve_image BASE_DIR, sys.path in settings). Non-Windows deployments require adjusting these paths accordingly.

- Required local processes/services
  - Django development server or WSGI/ASGI host running udtBackEnd (uses Python packages specified in code).
  - SUMO stack installed locally with libtraci available to Python; sumo/sumo-gui on PATH.
  - MongoDB listening on localhost:27017 with database 'orion-openiot' (Orion-LD’s data store accessed directly by the web app Device model).
  - TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL) on localhost:{TIMESCALE_DB_PORT} with database 'quantumleap' and user postgres/postgres (as per code).
  - Grafana available at http://localhost:3000 for dashboards embedded in templates.

- Required FIWARE services (reachable per configuration)
  - Orion-LD Context Broker accessible to the application at hostname: localhost and port ORIONLD_PORT (ngsildclient.Client in Broker creates connections with tenant openiot).
  - IoT Agent (JSON):
    - Northbound API at http://{hostname}:{IOTA_NORTH_PORT} for service and device registration (/iot/services, /iot/devices).
    - Southbound ingestion at http://{hostname}:{IOTA_SOUTH_PORT}/iot/json for measurement ingestion.
  - QuantumLeap:
    - Notification endpoint configured as http://fiware-quantumleap:{QUANTUMLEAP_PORT}/v2/notify in Orion-LD subscriptions (expects DNS name resolution within the Orion-LD network, typically a Docker network).

- Environment variables and runtime settings
  - Ports are read at runtime from fiwareenv/.env via loadEnvVar:
    - IOTA_NORTH_PORT, IOTA_SOUTH_PORT, ORIONLD_PORT, TIMESCALE_DB_PORT, QUANTUMLEAP_PORT.
  - SUMO runtime environment variables set by SumoSimulator:
    - STATICPATH, ROUTEFILEPATH, TYPEPATH, DETECTORPATH (pointing to SUMO_PATH subfolders).
  - Django STATICFILES_DIRS points to udtBackEnd/udtApp/static.

- Python runtime and libraries (as imported by code)
  - Django, mongoengine, pymongo, psycopg2, ngsildclient, requests, pandas, geopandas, shapely, sumolib, libtraci/traci, numpy, scipy, Pillow, matplotlib, pytz.

- File-system permissions and expectations
  - The process must be able to create and write under:
    - data/preprocessing/generated/, data/digitalshadow/.
    - sumoenv/output, sumoenv/routes, sumoenv/static (TAZ and detector outputs), and per-simulation result folders.
  - TimescaleDB user must be able to CREATE VIEW on the referenced tables in schema mtopeniot.

### Dependencies between nodes

- Physical data emulation and ingestion path
  - MobilityVirtualEnvironment (mobilityvenv):
    - Reads real traffic loop CSVs from data/realworlddata/mvenvdata/flows.
    - For each timeslot, Sensor.sendData → Agent.retrievingData → Agent.measurementSending performs HTTP POST to IoT Agent Southbound /iot/json with k (API key) and i (device id).
    - Agent also ensures IoT Agent service-group and device registration via IoT Agent Northbound (/iot/services, /iot/devices). Registration payloads include cbroker "http://orion:{ORIONLD_PORT}" which assumes IoT Agent can resolve "orion" within its network.

- Context management and shadow resolution
  - Broker.updateContext (ngsildclient) connects to Orion-LD at localhost:{ORIONLD_PORT} with tenant openiot to:
    - Resolve road shadows via DigitalShadowManager using CSV under data/digitalshadow/digital_shadow_types.csv.
    - Create/update Road, RoadSegment, and TrafficFlowObserved entities (Smart Data Models) and inter-entity relations.
  - DigitalShadowManager uses preprocessed mapping from preprocessingUtils.filterForShadowManager and supports on-demand shadow creation.

- Historical persistence flow
  - SubscriptionManager.QuantumLeapManager creates Orion-LD subscriptions that notify QuantumLeap at http://fiware-quantumleap:{QUANTUMLEAP_PORT}/v2/notify on updates to trafficFlow for the three entity types. QuantumLeap persists events into TimescaleDB (schema mtopeniot).
  - TimescaleDB is queried directly by TimescaleManager.retrieveHistoricalDataForTimeslot to drive simulations and calibrations.

- Web application data access
  - udtBackEnd/udtApp:
    - Reads Orion-LD’s MongoDB (database orion-openiot, collection entities) via mongoengine Device Document for entity list/detail pages.
    - Orchestrates simulations via DigitalTwinManager from the web form (simulationModeler), which pulls historical data via TimescaleManager, runs SUMO, and then reads SUMO outputs for result pages.

- Simulation and modeling
  - DigitalTwinManager and Planner/ScenarioGenerator:
    - Generate edge-weighted route inputs from processed_traffic_flow.csv and edgedata.xml.
    - Invoke SUMO Tools (randomTrips.py, routeSampler.py) and run SUMO via libtraci; write outputs under SUMO_PATH.
  - statisticUtils and TrafficModeler analyze SUMO outputs (tripinfos.xml, edgedata-output.xml) to compute metrics and error summaries for result rendering in the Django app.

- Cross-process naming and networking assumptions
  - The application process uses localhost to reach Orion-LD, IoT Agent north/south, TimescaleDB, MongoDB, and Grafana.
  - IoT Agent and QuantumLeap are addressed by Orion-LD using Docker-internal hostnames "orion" and "fiware-quantumleap" in registration/subscription payloads. This implies Orion-LD, IoT Agent, and QuantumLeap must be on a shared network where those names resolve (e.g., a Docker Compose deployment), while the application itself talks to localhost ports exposed by those containers.

- Data preprocessing dependencies
  - preprocessingUtils relies on SUMO network (full.net.xml) and SUMO Tools (detector/mapDetectors.py) to:
    - Map detectors, deduplicate, and generate detectors.add.xml.
    - Export TAZ polygons to SUMO additional files from zone CSVs.
    - Produce processed CSVs required by DigitalShadowManager and the Digital Twin pipeline.

% 8.1 — Deployment Diagram
# Section 8.1 — Deployment Diagram

This section describes the runtime deployment topology derived from the codebase. The system comprises a Python runtime that orchestrates data preprocessing, a mobility virtual environment, FIWARE interactions, and SUMO-based simulations; a Django web application for monitoring and calibration; FIWARE components (IoT Agent JSON, Orion Context Broker, QuantumLeap); persistence layers (TimescaleDB for time-series, MongoDB for entity snapshots); and Grafana for dashboards. All inter-node communications, endpoints, and file-system interactions shown below are directly evidenced in the source code.

Figure 8.1 — Deployment Diagram (section-8-1-deployment.puml)

![diagram_004_87fa48a9ea](diagram_004_87fa48a9ea.png)

The diagram shows:

- End-user access to the Django web application for browsing entities and driving simulations. Django reads entities from MongoDB (database orion-openiot, collection entities) and embeds Grafana dashboards served at http://localhost:3000.  
- The Python runtime (main.py and libraries) encapsulates the DigitalTwinManager, Agent, Broker, Subscription/QuantumLeap management, preprocessing utilities, and the Mobility Virtual Environment. It communicates with the IoT Agent JSON (northbound for service/device provisioning; southbound for measurement ingestion), and directly updates the Orion Context Broker via ngsildclient.  
- Orion forwards notifications to QuantumLeap, which persists time-series in TimescaleDB. The runtime and Django access TimescaleDB (views mtopeniot.traffic_view and mtopeniot.roadsegm_view are created by the application).  
- SUMO simulations run locally via libtraci, with routes generated via SUMO Tools (randomTrips.py, routeSampler.py). Simulation inputs/outputs and preprocessed datasets are stored under sumoenv/ and data/... folders.
